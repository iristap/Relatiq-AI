Investing.com -- GMI Cloud announced Monday it will construct a $500 million artificial intelligence data center in Taiwan with support from U.S. chipmaker NASDAQ:NVDA.

The U.S.-based cloud services provider plans to bring the facility online by March 2026. The data center will be powered by Nvidia’s new Blackwell GB300 chips and will house approximately 7,000 GPUs across 96 high-density racks. The facility will be capable of processing nearly 2 million tokens per second and will consume around 16 megawatts of power.

GMI Cloud Founder and CEO Alex Yeh emphasized that Taiwan needs more data centers as "strategic assets" to support its AI development. He noted that the island’s power-supply challenges can be addressed.

Yeh also mentioned that AI demand has been robust, with the company’s GPU utilization "almost full."

"You want to promote local ecosystems - you have to build the data centre first, you have to build the AI cluster first," Yeh said.
