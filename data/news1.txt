Investing.com - Cantor Fitzgerald has maintained its Overweight rating and $300.00 price target on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) ahead of the company’s upcoming earnings report, scheduled for November 19. The semiconductor giant, currently valued at $4.62 trillion, has seen 13 analysts revise their earnings expectations upward for the upcoming period according to InvestingPro data.

The firm described NVIDIA’s earnings report as "THE event of earnings season," though it expects updates to be "more incremental" following the company’s GTC event on October 28.

Cantor Fitzgerald anticipates that "another solid beat/raise and positive commentary on the demand backdrop should be well received," with particular attention on any statements regarding visibility and growth extending into 2027. This outlook aligns with NVIDIA’s impressive 71.55% revenue growth over the last twelve months to $165.22 billion.

The research firm projects more than 40% earnings per share upside versus consensus estimates for calendar year 2026, supporting its continued bullish stance on the stock. InvestingPro analysis shows NVIDIA trading at a P/E ratio of 54.2 but with a favorable PEG ratio of 0.82, suggesting reasonable valuation relative to its growth rate despite appearing slightly overvalued based on InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment.

NVIDIA remains Cantor Fitzgerald’s "hands-down TOP PICK," with the $300 price target representing 24 times the firm’s upside earnings per share estimate for calendar year 2027. This target falls within the broader analyst range of $100-$350, with the overall analyst consensus maintaining a Strong Buy recommendation at 1.34.
