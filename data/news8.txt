Investing.com -- President Trump decided not to discuss the export of Nvidia’s advanced Blackwell AI chips to China during his October 30 meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, following strong opposition from his top advisers.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials warned Trump that allowing the export of these chips would threaten national security by boosting China’s AI capabilities. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also opposed the approval.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been lobbying extensively to maintain access to the Chinese market, which he estimates is home to about half of the world’s AI researchers. "I really hope President Trump will help us find a solution," Huang said at an Nvidia event in Washington before the Trump-Xi meeting. "Right now we’re in an awkward place."

The decision represents a significant setback for Nvidia, as exports of Blackwell chips to China could potentially generate tens of billions of dollars in sales.
